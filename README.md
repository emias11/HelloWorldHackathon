## Inspiration
Tired of constantly searching for new music on your own? Band Together allows people to connect through their love of music and to share music from all over the world whilst making new friends.

## What it does
It's a platform where a user can share a unique set of music with others. Users can choose one playlist from their Spotify that they want to share. They will then be put into a virtual room with 3 other users and could listen to each otherâ€™s music. At the same time, they could share their appreciation for the music or just chat in general.

## How we built it
We built the web app using Flask, html, CSS and python.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting authentication from Spotify proved to be difficult. Implementing a fully working chat room was harder than we thought but was resolved in the end. Piecing our work together on Flask was tough but was fulfilling when we saw it working.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to play the music on our web app. Working together and supporting each other even though moral was low at times.

## What we learned
How to use GitHub in a collaborative and organized way. How to navigate the Spotify API.

## What's next for Band Together
There will be a drop down for users to choose from all their playlists instead of entering the name of their playlist. Creating a function where users can add songs to the playlist in the chatroom in real time. A user will be able to leave a chatroom and join another one. A user will also be able to choose which room they would like to go to according to genre.

## Built With
